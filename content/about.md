Hello, I'm Ayal.<br>
I'm a creative-technologist.<br>
Trying to look where no one else does. <br>
I live in Brooklyn, NYC.<br>
Used to be a helicopter pilot, now focusing on making my surroundings ask questions and wonder.

I work on - Audio and sound design, visual experiences, installations and web-development.

Graduating from NYU's <strong>ITP</strong> (interactive telecommunication program) at Tisch School of the Art.<br>

Strong intuition, social consciousness, and hutzpah. <br>

That is me, and that is my work.
