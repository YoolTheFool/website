Hello, I'm Ayal.<br>
I live in Brooklyn, NYC.<br>
Used to be a Helicopter pilot, now I'm not.<br>
Now, I think I am a creative-technologist.<br>

Working on - Audio and sound design, visual experiences, interactive installations and web-development.

Graduated from NYU's <b>ITP</b> (interactive telecommunication program) at Tisch School of the Art.<br>

Strong intuition, social consciousness, and hutzpah. <br>

That is me, and that is my work.
