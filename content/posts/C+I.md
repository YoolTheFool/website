A collaboration with <font size="4.5"> Isabella Vento </font>

In the summer of 2018, I was a part of a team from ITP that designed a major section at a 3 week pop-up museum at Fort-Mason, San-Francisco, called [COAL+ICE](http://coalandice.org/) - A major climate-change event lead by the Magnum foundation and Asia Society.
 My collaborators and I designed and built installations and exhibits covering the latest sustainability solutions.<br>

<br>
My collaborator, Isabella Vento, and I designed "Channeling Waste" -  <br>
an interactive, projection-mapping installation using Isadora and Arduino.
