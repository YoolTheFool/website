In Fall 2018, I took a class at NYU  with no other than [Morton Subotnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_Subotnick) - one of the first electronic-music giants, and a multimedia performance genius (were talking about early 60's).
Morton was a pioneer in experimenting and composing with audio-signals and control-voltage(CV) "machines".
One of these machines (which Morton was a part of the development team) is the Buchla modular-synth.

(Buchla 200-e model)

Created by [Don Buchla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Buchla), this marvelous west-coast synth is a factory for pure sound synthesis.
Buchla took the CV (control-voltage) and the modulations to a much higher level, thus allowing the new-born genre to evolve and reach out to musicians and sound engineers everywhere.

I hope that's enough intro, so I can move on to the work itself...

<font size="6"> The Feedback </font> loop is one of the supporting pillars of modular synthesis, and the Buchla is wielding it like a battle-axe.
You take one end of the pipe, and "meld" it to another pipes system (or back to the same one). <br>
This turns the sound modulation and generation to be an ever changing spectrum of musical expressions.


<font size="5"> So, I decided </font> to take this feedback idea and see what happens if you make a loop that goes through different dimensions.

Analog => Digital => Physical => Analog

i.e.

Record sound transitions from the Buchla, <br>
Create a 3D representation of the transitions, <br>
Carve the 3D transition in the CNC router-mill, <br>
Record the CNC while it carves the piece, <br>
Feedback the recordings to the envelope-follower module in the Buchla.

<font size="5 ">The steps:</font> <br>

1. Record sound transitions from the Buchla - I decided on 2 transitions:
  Sine wave - pitch shift
  {{< vimeo 313706570 >}}<br>
  Timbre - frequency shift
  {{< vimeo 313706597 >}}<br>
2. In Processing - draw the waveforms and take "snapshots" of the beginning and the end of the transition - <br>

3. Create the 3D representations - <br>

4. Carve the transitions in the CNC, and record the sounds -<br>

Transition 1 - Sine pitch-shift
<!-- ![](/gallery/images/cumbersome/SineRotation.gif) -->
Transition 2 - Timbre frequency-shift
<!-- ![](/gallery/images/cumbersome/timbreRotate.gif) -->

5. Feed the audio from the CNC to the envelope-follower in the Buchla -<br>

* What's the <font size = "5">Envelope-Follower</font> module? <br>
This module uses an audio signal as an input, i.e. a microphone or an audio recording/file, and transforms it into CV (control-voltage).<br>
This is an important tool when creating and interacting with the Buchla.
In other words - this allows you to bring an "outside" input and let it modulate, god! modulate everything!

<font size = "5"> So, here are the CNC sounds modulating the patch at the Buchla</font>

(This is what we're here for)<br>
